- **Reconnection Strategy**: Added exponential backoff for reconnection attempts to prevent overwhelming the server
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: Implemented a heartbeat system to detect disconnections and maintain connection health
- **Message Buffering**: Added buffering for messages during disconnection periods to prevent data loss

### Caching Implementation
- **API Response Caching**: Implemented a caching system for API responses to reduce unnecessary network requests
- **Configurable TTL**: Added time-to-live (TTL) settings for cached data to ensure freshness
- **Selective Cache Invalidation**: Implemented targeted cache invalidation based on WebSocket update messages
- **Memory Management**: Added limits to cache size to prevent memory issues

### Frontend Rendering Optimization
- **Component Memoization**: Applied React.memo to all components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Optimized State Management**: Restructured state management to minimize render cycles
- **useCallback for Event Handlers**: Implemented useCallback for all event handlers to maintain referential equality
- **useMemo for Expensive Calculations**: Added useMemo for computationally expensive operations
- **Virtualization**: Implemented virtualization techniques for long lists to improve performance

## Frontend UI/UX Enhancements

### Knowledge Graph
- **Visualization Enhancement**: Improved D3.js integration for better graph visualization
- **Interaction Controls**: Added zoom, pan, and reset controls for better user interaction
- **Node Tooltips**: Implemented tooltips for node information on hover
- **15-Second Updates**: Ensured graph updates every 15 seconds as per requirements
- **Responsive Sizing**: Made graph visualization responsive to container size

### Terminal View
- **Output Filtering**: Added filtering by output type (command, output, error, info)
- **Auto-Scrolling Control**: Implemented toggleable auto-scrolling with visual indicator
- **Command Highlighting**: Enhanced visual distinction between commands and outputs
- **Timestamp Formatting**: Improved timestamp display for better readability
- **Overflow Management**: Implemented proper overflow handling with memory limits

## Backend Optimizations
