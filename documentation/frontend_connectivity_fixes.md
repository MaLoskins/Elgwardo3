# Frontend Connectivity Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix the frontend connectivity issues where only the Knowledge Graph was visible while other components showed "connecting" or were empty.

## WebSocket Connection Improvements

### App.js
- Implemented robust WebSocket connection management with automatic reconnection logic
- Added exponential backoff for reconnection attempts to prevent overwhelming the server
- Implemented a heartbeat system to detect disconnections and maintain connection health
- Added a manual reconnect button for user-initiated reconnection
- Improved visual feedback for connection status

### apiService.js
- Implemented caching system for API responses to reduce unnecessary network requests
- Added retry mechanisms for failed API requests
- Implemented fallback to cached data when network requests fail
- Enhanced error handling with detailed logging

## Component Rendering Improvements

### GraphViewer.js
- Improved D3.js integration for better graph visualization
- Added proper empty state handling
- Enhanced zoom and pan controls
- Improved rendering performance

### TerminalView.js
- Added proper empty state handling
- Implemented filtering by output type
- Added auto-scrolling control
- Enhanced visual distinction between commands and outputs

### ToDoList.js
- Improved task sorting and filtering
- Enhanced visual representation of task status
- Added proper empty state handling
- Improved subtask display and interaction

### AgentActivityMonitor.js
- Added proper empty state handling
- Enhanced activity type visualization
- Improved timestamp formatting

### StatusDisplay.js
- Improved status visualization with color-coded indicators
- Enhanced timestamp formatting
- Added fallback to default values when data is unavailable

### ProgressBar.js
- Improved visual feedback with color-coded progress
- Enhanced animation for smoother transitions

## Additional UI Components

### Header.js and Footer.js
- Added consistent styling across the application
- Improved responsive design for various screen sizes

## Testing

All components have been tested to ensure they:
1. Handle connection failures gracefully
2. Display appropriate empty states when data is unavailable
3. Reconnect automatically when possible
4. Provide visual feedback about connection status

These improvements should resolve the issues where components were not displaying properly or showing "connecting" indefinitely.
